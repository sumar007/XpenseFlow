      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        BigTime Software, Inc. (“BigTime”, “we”, “our”, and “us”) respects your
        concerns about privacy and personal data protection and we value our
        relationship with you. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies solely to
        personal information we collect from you via our website at BigTime.net
        (the “Site”) and through our on-demand support platform, tools and
        services offered on the Site (the “Service”). Please read this Policy
        carefully, because by accessing and using the Site and Service you are
        acknowledging that you understand and agree to the terms of this Policy.
      </p>
      <h3>Personal Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>
        Personal Information You Manually Provide. When you register for the
        Service or sign up for a free trial account, we collect personal
        information such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your name</li>
        <li>company name and address </li>
        <li>e-mail address </li>
        <li>credit card information</li>
      </ul>

    <p>If you sign up for a free trial account, you are not required to enter your credit card information until you decide to continue with a paid plan. BigTime uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing, and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on BigTime’s behalf.

</p>

<p>If you speak with us on the telephone, we will collect any personal information you provide to us and we may record such conversations for quality assurance and training purposes.</p>
<p>You can modify your account information at any time by clicking on the Admin link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen on the Site. </p>

<p>Information Sent to Us By Your Web Browser.  We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser or mobile device. This information typically includes your IP address, the identity of your Internet service provider, the name and version of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit. The information we receive may depend on your browser or device settings.</p>

<p>Generally, we use this information in the aggregate to help us improve this Site and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors. We may combine it with other information in an attempt to identify you or we may combine it with information that does identify you. We may also review our server logs for security purposes, for example, to detect intrusions into our network, and we might share our server logs, which contain visitors’ IP addresses, with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify you.</p>


<p>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies.  We use “cookies” and other technologies to collect information and support certain features of the Site.</p>
<h3>How We Use Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>BigTime uses the personal information it collects about you to operate and make the Service available to you, for billing, identification and authentication purposes, to contact you about your use of the Service, research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service and Site.  BigTime’s practice is not to use your personal information for marketing purposes.

</p>
<h3>Choices About Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>We offer certain choices about how we communicate with you and what personal information we obtain about you and share with others.  </p>
<p>In General. We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use, and disclose your information. In addition, we may ask you to indicate your choices at the time and on the page where you provide your information.  For example, we may give you choice about the types of email communications you receive from us and/or our business partners.  </p>
<p>Email preferences. You cannot opt out of transactional emails related to your membership/registration with the Site.  However, you can opt out of promotional emails we send you. If you wish to stop receiving promotional emails, simply select “unsubscribe” located at the bottom of each communication.</p>
<p>Do Not Track.  Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals, we do not respond to them at this time. </p>
<p>Cookies.   When you visit the Site or use the Service, we use session “cookies” – a piece of information stored on your computer – to allow the Site or Service to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to enable BigTime to process your online transactions. Session cookies also help us confirm your identity and are required in order to use the Service. BigTime uses persistent cookies that only BigTime can read and use, to identify you as a BigTime customer and make it easier for you to log in to the Service. Users who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site, but will not be able to access or take advantage of the Service.</p>
<h3>Information Sharing</h3>
<p>BigTime may transmit or share your personal information with its third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other technology and services required to operate and maintain the Service, which may require that your personal information be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of BigTime and the authorized third parties referred to here. </p>
<p>We may also disclose personal information:</p>
<ul>
    <p>to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims</p>
    <p>if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. BigTime may also provide summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will not include personally identifying information. </p>
<p>in the event that we are subject to mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, sales of assets, reorganizations, divestitures, dissolutions, bankruptcies, liquidations, or other types of business transactions. In these types of transactions, personal information may be shared, sold, or transferred, and it may be used subsequently by a third party. </p>
</ul>

<p>If you are not a resident of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your personal information outside your home jurisdiction, and that we may store your personal information in the United States or elsewhere. Please note that the level of legal protection provided in the United States from which you may access our Site may not be as stringent as that under privacy standards or the privacy laws of other countries, possibly including your home jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>Protection of Information</h3>
<p>BigTime maintains reasonable security measures to protect your information from loss, destruction, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure. These technologies help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to You and to those You provided authorized access. However, no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
<h3>Third Party Links</h3>
<p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our Site. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.

<li>you have consented to this collection and processing for a specific purpose;</li>
<li>it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations; or</li>
<li>it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.</li>

<p>Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline consent at any time.  Some examples of where we rely on your consent to process your personal data include sending you marketing emails. If you wish to withdraw your consent, please contact us at legal@bigtimesoftware.net. </p>

You may also have the right to receive a copy of your personal data in a commonly used and machine-readable format, and to transmit such data to another controller.

<h3>Transfers, Storage, and Processing</h3>
<p>Our Site is from and hosted on servers located in the United States. If you access and use our website from a location outside of the United States, any personal data you provide to us or that is otherwise collected may be transferred to and processed in the United States or any other jurisdiction in our sole discretion. Users of our Site should be aware that the laws that apply to the use and protection of personal data in the United States or other countries or jurisdictions to which we transfer, or in which we process, personal data may differ from those of your country of residence. Users who access or use our Site from jurisdictions outside of the United States do so at their own choice and risk and are solely responsible for compliance with local law. While we take steps to safeguard your personal data, the United States has NOT been deemed by the European Commission to ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data.  Accordingly, the level of protection provided in the United States or other non-EU countries and jurisdictions from which you may access our Site may not be as stringent as that under EU data protection standards or the data protection laws of some other countries, possibly including your home jurisdiction.</p>
<p>If we are processing your personal data on behalf of another party, your personal data is transferred across borders to the United States or to other countries or jurisdictions in which we or our third-party associates may process personal data through the use of Standard Contract Clauses. </p>
